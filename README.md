To run my visualisation, run the csvToPy file
Enter 2 (compare teams)
Enter 7 (Liverpool)
Enter 2 (Manchester United)
Enter wins

This can also be accessed from the main branch as it is an example of what can be shown from the comparing teams option which I wrote the code for.


To run visualisation 2:
Run the csvToPy file
