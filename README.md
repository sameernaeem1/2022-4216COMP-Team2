To run my visualisation, run the csvToPy file
Enter 2 (compare teams)
Enter 7 (Liverpool)
Enter 2 (Manchester United)
Enter wins
Visualisation should open up (maximize to see properly)


This can also be accessed from the main branch as it is an example of what can be shown from the comparing teams option which I wrote the code for.
